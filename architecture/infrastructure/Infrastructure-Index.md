# Infrastructure Index

**Physical substrate and spatial architecture of the Nimmerverse.**

## Overview

Infrastructure documents describe the physical world that organisms inhabit — the actual furniture, cameras, and spatial layouts that form the real garden. This is where digital dreams meet physical reality.

## Documents

### [Kallax Grid World](Kallax-Grid-World.md)
Street-liberated IKEA as sim-to-real bridge.
- 40×40×40cm standardized cells
- 12 garage stations across lab/kitchen
- The 1m rule: pure geometry below, chaos above
- Bird's eye camera rig on oak crafting table
- **Status**: Concept ready, Baumarkt run planned

## Design Principles

1. **Salvage First** — Street-liberated over store-bought
2. **Uniformity Enables** — Standard cells eliminate geometric noise
3. **Sim-Real Parity** — What you model is what you get
4. **Constraints Are Features** — IKEA dimensions become architecture

## Physical Locations

| Location | Infrastructure | Function |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Lab** | Kallax grid + crafting table | Primary organism arena |
| **Kitchen** | Kallax cells | Extended garage network |
