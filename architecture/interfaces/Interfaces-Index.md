# Interfaces Index

**Physical and digital interfaces to the Nimmerverse.**

---

## Overview

Interfaces are how the Nimmerverse *touches the world* — the boundary between digital infrastructure and physical reality. This includes hardware displays, control surfaces, and software UIs.

## Physical Interfaces

### [Heartbeat Sculpture](Heartbeat-Sculpture.md)
LED light sculpture showing the Nimmerverse heartbeats.
- Infinity symbol (∞) inside a ring of time
- Real Garden + Virtual Garden as the two loops
- Pulses with actual system heartbeats via NATS
- **Status**: Concept ready, build planned for holiday week

### [Nimmerswarm Interface](Nimmerswarm-Interface.md)
Optical state broadcasting between organisms.
- LED matrices on organisms broadcast cell states as light patterns
- Camera + raytracing = sub-cm 3D positioning
- Heartbeat protocol: "I see you" between organisms
- Hierarchical perception: Cell → Organism → Swarm → Nyx
- Cognitive offloading: Reflexes at lower layers free Nyx's attention
- **Status**: Core concept, ready to branch

## Digital Interfaces

### Command Center *(planned)*
Godot-based visualization and control UI.
- Subscribes to all NATS channels
- Visualizes system state, message flow
- Allows dafit to observe and intervene
- **Status**: Conceptual

## Design Principles

1. **Visibility** — Make the invisible visible
2. **Physicality** — Digital systems deserve physical presence
3. **Symbolism** — Interfaces encode meaning, not just data
4. **Integration** — Connected to real system state via NATS
5. **Beauty** — Aesthetics matter (see [Style Guide](../../assets/nimmerverse-style-index.md))
