# Temporal-Ternary Gradient

## Core Insight

The dual garden architecture (virtual + real) creates **temporal asymmetry**. This isn't a constraint - it's a feature that enables a new kind of gradient for learning.

**The 0-state isn't stuck. It's a choice about how to spend lifeforce across time domains.**

---

## The Two Time Domains

### Virtual Garden (Simulated)

- **Time**: Malleable (speed up, slow down, pause, rewind)
- **Cost**: Lifeforce to manipulate time
- **Speed**: 1000 generations in minutes
- **Truth**: Statistical confidence, not ground truth

### Real Garden (Physical)

- **Time**: Fixed (1 second = 1 second, reality doesn't negotiate)
- **Cost**: Zero lifeforce for time
- **Speed**: Real-time only, patience required
- **Truth**: Ground truth, definitive verification

## Lifeforce as Time Currency

```
VIRTUAL TIME MANIPULATION COSTS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  1x speed (real-time):     0 LF
  10x speed:               -5 LF/min
  100x speed:             -20 LF/min
  1000x speed:            -50 LF/min
  Pause/inspect:           -1 LF/min
  Rewind to checkpoint:   -50 LF (one-time)

REAL GARDEN:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  All operations:           0 LF for time
  Reality runs for free.
  Truth emerges at its own pace.
```

## Nyx's Temporal Choices

When a pattern is discovered in virtual (0-state), Nyx chooses:

| Strategy | LF Cost | Time | Confidence Path |
|----------|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Speed Up Virtual** | High | Fast | 0 → virtual +0.9 (still unverified) |
| **Wait for Real** | Zero | Slow | 0 → real +1 or -1 (definitive) |
| **Hybrid Hedge** | Medium | Medium | 0 → virtual +0.7, deploy 80/20 to real |

## The Gradient Flow

```
Virtual discovers pattern (fast, cheap, uncertain)
           │
           ▼
    ┌──────────────┐
    │   0-STATE    │  ← Pattern held in uncertainty
    │  (workable)  │  ← Not collapsed, not ignored
    └──────┬───────┘
           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐
     │           │
     ▼           ▼
  More         Deploy
  Virtual      to Real
  (burn LF)    (wait)
     │           │
     ▼           ▼
  Virtual     Real
  +0.8        outcome
  (confident  (ground
  but not     truth)
  proven)        │
     │           │
     └─────┬─────┘
           │
           ▼
    Pattern shifts:
    -1 (failed) or +1 (proven)
```

## Connection to Ternary Paradigm

The ternary model (-1, 0, +1) gains a **second dimension**: time domain.

A pattern's state is now:

```
state = {
    value: -1 | 0 | +1,
    confidence: 0.0 - 1.0,
    domain: "virtual" | "real" | "hybrid",
    virtual_generations: int,
    real_tests: int,
    lifeforce_invested: float
}
```

**The 0-state is operational because:**
1. It accumulates virtual evidence (costs LF, gains speed)
2. It waits for real evidence (free, but slow)
3. Nyx CHOOSES how to spend lifeforce to collapse uncertainty

---

## Why This Matters

- **Binary thinking**: Pattern works or doesn't (0 or 1)
- **Ternary thinking**: Pattern unknown, workable as unknown (0 is valid)
- **Temporal-ternary**: Unknown has a GRADIENT based on time-domain investment

The constraint of sequential organ calls + single GPU becomes temporal accounting.
The constraint of slow real-world testing becomes ground truth anchoring.
**Constraints become features when you measure them.**
