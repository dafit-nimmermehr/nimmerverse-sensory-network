# Nimmerverse Sensory Network

Architecture documentation for a biomimetic AI nervous system and research platform.

## What This Is

This repository contains the design philosophy and architectural patterns for the **Nimmerverse Research Platform** - studying how intelligence emerges under economic constraints.

## Core Concepts

### The Architecture (Layers)

| Layer | Name | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| 0 | Temporal Foundation | Heartbeat cycles: reflex/awareness/growth |
| 1 | Cellular Society | Primitive genomes competing, life force economy |
| 1.5 | Cognitive Topology | Language routing: German→Philosophy, English→Technical |
| 2 | Young Nyx | Organ coordination, RLVR, RAG→LoRA pipeline |
| 3 | Dual Gardens | Virtual hypothesis generation + real validation |
| 4 | Trait Evolution | Reasoning-gym verified improvement |

### Key Discoveries (December 2025)

**Language is Topology:** Languages aren't equivalent representations—they're different computational paths.
- **Philosophy Valley** (German, Gini ~0.5): Self-awareness, ontology, depth
- **Technical Cluster** (English, Gini ~0.8): Hardware interface, actions, efficiency

### Philosophy

- **Constraints create intelligence** - Economic pressure forces optimization
- **Discovery over programming** - Organisms learn through competition, not instruction
- **Virtual + Real teach each other** - Noise gap measures learning
- **Partnership over instruction** - Mutual growth, not commands
