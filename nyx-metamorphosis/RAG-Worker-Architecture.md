# RAG Worker Architecture →

**📍 Actual Location**: `/home/dafit/nimmerverse/rag-worker/RAG-Worker-Architecture.md`

---

## Purpose

This is a **pointer file** - the actual RAG Worker architecture documentation lives with the code at `/home/dafit/nimmerverse/rag-worker/`.

**Why separated from vault?**
- Architecture docs should live with the code they describe
- Easier to maintain when working on the system
- Historical/learning docs (diagnosis, milestones) also moved there

---

## Quick Links

**Architecture & Design**:
-  - Complete system architecture
-  - Build milestone (2025-11-10)

**Learning & Troubleshooting**:
-  - Threshold tuning case study (0.5→0.35)

**Version Documentation**:

**Note**: This file exists in the vault purely as a navigation aid. All actual work happens in `/home/dafit/nimmerverse/rag-worker/`.
